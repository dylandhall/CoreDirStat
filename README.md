# CoreDirStat

A very simple directory size statistics program written in .net 6.0 - I found WinDirStat to be quite slow and wondered if I could do it faster.

A simple implementation in .net 6 is very fast indeed!

I have not included any real visualisation beyond showing how much data each folder has comparitively, but that's the key information.

You can find a pre-built binary attached to the latest release here: https://github.com/dylandhall/CoreDirStat/releases/download/v1.0.2/build.zip

You will need the latest version of .net 6 to run it. Download here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

I might update it to MAUI once available so it runs on linux too, just for fun.
