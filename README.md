# CoreDirStat

A very simple directory size statistics program written in .net 6.0 - I found WinDirStat to be quite slow and wondered if I could do it faster.

I can, but I haven't placed any limit on threads or anything - it works great on my PC however! Very fast - on a slower PC it might be a struggle. Raise an issue and I'll limit threadcount if you like.

I have not included any real visualisation beyond showing how much data each folder has comparitively.

You can find a pre-built binary attached to the latest release, however you will need the latest version of .net 6 to run it. Download here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

I might update it to MAUI once available so it runs on linux too, just for fun.
